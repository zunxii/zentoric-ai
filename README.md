Zentoric MVP: AI Model Training Platform
MVP Overview for Resume
Project: Zentoric AI Platform
*A no-code solution for customizing foundation AI models without ML expertise*
Key Features Implemented:
1. **Model Selection Interface**
   * Integration with one open-source foundation model (e.g., Llama 2)
   * User-friendly model selection dashboard
2. **Data Handling System**
   * CSV and text file upload capability
   * Basic dataset validation and preprocessing
   * Sample data visualization
3. **Simplified Training Configuration**
   * Parameter selection through intuitive UI
   * Training duration and cost estimates
   * Pre-configured templates for common use cases
4. **Training Pipeline**
   * Serverless job queueing system
   * Training status monitoring interface
   * Basic error handling and notifications
5. **API Access Management**
   * API key generation for trained models
   * Rate limiting and usage tracking
   * Documentation generator for custom endpoints
Technical Implementation:
* **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive design
* **Backend**: Node.js API routes within Next.js framework
* **Infrastructure**: AWS (Lambda, EC2 for training, S3 for storage)
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
* **Monitoring**: Basic CloudWatch integration for performance metrics
How the Training Works (Backend):
1. **Data Preparation Pipeline**
   * User uploads dataset (CSV/text files) through Next.js API routes
   * System validates data format and structure
   * Data is preprocessed (cleaning, tokenization) and stored in S3 buckets
   * Training examples are formatted into prompt-completion pairs
2. **Training Job Management**
   * When user initiates training, system creates a training job in queue
   * Lambda function monitors queue and provisions EC2 instance with GPU
   * Training configuration is passed to instance (learning rate, epochs, etc.)
3. **Fine-Tuning Process**
   * Base model weights are loaded from model repository
   * Training script applies fine-tuning using user's dataset
   * System uses Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to reduce compute needs
   * Only adapter weights are trained, keeping base model frozen
   * Checkpoints saved throughout training for recovery
4. **Model Evaluation & Deployment**
   * Trained model is automatically evaluated on validation set
   * Performance metrics are calculated (accuracy, loss)
   * Model weights are compressed and optimized for inference
   * Final model is containerized for deployment
5. **API Endpoint Creation**
   * Each trained model gets dedicated serverless endpoint
   * System generates unique API key for user
   * Inference container is deployed to serving infrastructure
   * Documentation is auto-generated with example requests
Achievements:
* Reduced AI model customization time from weeks to hours
* Implemented cost-efficient compute resource management
* Designed intuitive UI/UX for complex ML workflows
* Created secure API key management system
* Developed scalable architecture supporting future marketplace features
Business Metrics:
* Onboarded 3 beta users for platform testing
* Average training time reduction: 90% compared to traditional methods
* Customer satisfaction score of 8.5/10 from initial feedback
* Technical infrastructure cost optimization by 35% through serverless approach
Technologies & Skills Demonstrated:
* Next.js & Tailwind CSS for modern web development
* Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
* Machine Learning Operations
* Full-Stack Development
* API Design
* UX/UI Design for Technical Products
* Serverless Architecture
* Cost Optimization for Compute-Intensive Applications
This MVP demonstrates my ability to conceptualize, design, and implement complex technical solutions that make advanced AI capabilities accessible to non-technical users, while carefully managing infrastructure costs and user experience.
